Title: Efficient graph representation and manipulation in Bioconductor
Description: Implements classes for representing and manipulating directed
	and undirected graphs (DGraph and UGraph classes). Both the edges
	and nodes of a DGraph or UGraph object can be annotated via the use
	of "metadata columns".
